Once you download the project, you need to run the command "composer install" on your terminal/sell program to download and install all the dependencies.
Also run the "php artisan key:generate --ansi" command to generate the ANSI Key

Furthermore, in the .env file set up your DB parametres accordingly

You do not really need to run the "php artisan migrate" command as there is an SQL file in the database folder. All you need to do is create your MySQL database and import the moviecatalog database inside the database folder. This will show you the movies I have saved into the database file already.
